# Telemetry

When you launch Minecraft with Redstone Tools loaded for the first time you'll be asked whether you want to enable telemetry or not. Telemetry allows us mod developers to improve the quality of the mod and find and solve issues faster, absolutely no personal data is sent to our servers or stored anywhere so please consider enabling it.

<br>

# Macros

One of Redstone Tools' biggest features is the macro system it adds. The macro system allows users to increase their productivity by removing the need to type commands into the chat and instead lets the user press a key to run a single or multiple commands (macros can also be triggered using a command, they don't require keybinds). Below is a guide on how to get started using macros.

## The Macro Menu

To add, edit, delete, disable/enable or simply inspect macros you have to open the macro menu, to do this open the main menu (or the escape menu), and go to `Options... -> Controls... -> Macros...`. Once you're in the macro menu you'll be able to:

- Edit macros by clicking the pencil icon next to the macro you want to edit.
- Delete macros by clicking the red X next to the macro you want to delete.
- Disable/enable macros by unchecking/checking the box next to the macro you want to disable/enable.
- Create a new macro by pressing the `Create new...` button.

## The Macro Edit Screen

Once you're editing a macro you'll have the option to change its name, keybind, and commands. Note that changes won't be saved until you click `Done`, to discard changes you can click `Cancel` or press escape.
